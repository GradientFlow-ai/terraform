## Usage

You will need to set `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_OWNER` in your environment, after creating a personal access token on GitHub.

These should be set as local variables - but still pulled from the environment - to improve visibility but [there is a bug](https://github.com/integrations/terraform-provider-github/issues/1592).
