# S3 Storage

S3 is ideal for storing Parquet files. To enable users to upload/download embeddings files, we must support Parquet and pickle files, at least.

This is not the same as making them searchable in a vector database but it is a step forward.

A future task may be to create an S3 "folder" for each user.

## Usage

Running terraform commands from this folder appears necessary.
